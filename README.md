##The task is to build a straightforward, responsive webpage that connects to a public API—such as a weather or news service—and displays the data it receives. The main focus is on showing how a website can fetch information from an external source and update its content automatically, rather than just showing static information.

For development, I used standard web technologies. The structure of the page is built with HTML, while CSS is used to make sure the design is clean and adapts well to different screen sizes. JavaScript is responsible for making the API request, handling the response, and updating the page with the new data. For the API, I chose a public weather API, but the same approach would work for news or any other public data source.

The development process was straightforward:
- I set up the HTML to include a simple layout with a section where the API data would be displayed.
- CSS was added to make the page responsive, so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- In the JavaScript, I used the `fetch` function to request data from the API. Once the data was received, the script updated the relevant part of the page with the new information.

All of this was done using a basic code editor, like VS Code, and the webpage can be opened in any modern browser. There’s no need for a backend server or any special setup, since everything runs in the browser.

If the API or the type of data changes in the future, only the JavaScript code that handles the API request and processes the response would need to be updated. The rest of the page structure and styling can stay the same, unless the new data requires a different layout.

The overall approach was to keep things simple and easy to follow, focusing on the core functionality of fetching and displaying live data from an external source.
